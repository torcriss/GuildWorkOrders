/gwo post WTS [Copper Bar] 100 2g     # Quick post a sell order
/gwo list                              # Show all active orders
/gwo list WTB                          # Show only buy orders
/gwo search Iron                       # Search for Iron-related orders
/gwo my                                # Show your orders
/gwo stats                             # Show statistics
```

### Management Commands
```
/gwo cancel 1                          # Cancel your order #1
/gwo fulfill 2                         # Mark your order #2 as completed

### Admin Management
Access the password-protected admin clear system:

**Full Clear (All Orders):**
- **Admin Button** - Red "Admin" button in the UI status bar
- **Password**: `0000` (hashed and secured)
- **Two-Step Process**: Password entry + final confirmation
- **Global Effect**: Clears ALL orders for ALL guild members
- **Full Tracking**: Shows "Last clear: X ago by PlayerName" in status bar
- **Offline Protection**: Users who missed the clear get updated when they return

**Single Order Clear:**

**Security Features**:

- Password authentication for all admin actions
- Multiple confirmation dialogs with warnings
- Real-time status updates across all guild members

## How It Works

### Six-State Order Lifecycle
GuildWorkOrders uses a sophisticated 6-state system for order management:

1. **ACTIVE** - Newly created orders, visible to all players
2. **EXPIRED** - Orders that exceeded the 1-minute time limit
3. **CANCELLED** - Orders manually cancelled by the player
4. **COMPLETED** - Orders marked as fulfilled by the player  
5. **CLEARED** - Orders removed by admin action
6. **PURGED** - Internal cleanup state before permanent deletion

**State Transitions:**
- Active orders automatically expire after 1 minute
- Non-active orders (expired/cancelled/completed/cleared) transition to PURGED after 2 minutes
- PURGED orders are deleted after broadcasting for 4 minutes total
- All state changes sync instantly across all guild members

### Synchronization
- Orders are synchronized between guild members using hidden addon messages
- No guild chat spam - all communication is invisible to non-addon users
- **3-Second Heartbeat System** - Continuous rotating broadcasts ensure all users stay synchronized
- **Instant New Order Sync** - New orders broadcast immediately to all users
- **Advanced State Management** - Proper handling of all 6 order states with timestamps
- **Network Reliability** - Two-stage deletion with PURGED state prevents data loss
- **Rate Limiting** - Prevents flooding (max 5 messages per second with intelligent batching)

### Order Parsing
The addon automatically detects WTB/WTS patterns in guild chat:
- **WTB patterns**: "WTB", "LF", "looking for", "need", "buying", "ISO"
- **WTS patterns**: "WTS", "selling", "for sale", "have X for", "anyone need"
- Extracts item links, quantities, and prices automatically
- Only processes messages containing actual items

### Order Management
- **Rapid Turnover** - 1-minute order lifecycle for active trading
- **Automatic Cleanup** - Time-based cleanup prevents database bloat
- **Order Actions** - Players can cancel or mark their own orders as completed
- **Full History** - Complete tracking of completed orders with status details
- **Advanced Search** - Search and filter functionality with real-time updates
- **Admin Clear System** - Password-protected clearing with timestamp tracking

## Configuration

Access configuration via `/gwo config` or through the UI:

- **announceToGuild** - Announce new orders to guild chat (default: false)
- **autoSync** - Auto-sync on login (default: true)
- **soundAlert** - Play sound for new orders (default: true)
- **debugMode** - Enable debug logging (default: false)
- **orderExpiry** - Order expiry time in seconds (default: 60 = 1 minute)

## Requirements

- World of Warcraft Classic Era (Interface 11507)
- Must be in a guild to use synchronization features
- Other guild members need the addon for full functionality

## API

Other addons can interact with GuildWorkOrders:

```lua
-- Check if available
if _G.GuildWorkOrders and _G.GuildWorkOrders.IsAvailable() then
    -- Get order count
    local count = _G.GuildWorkOrders.GetOrderCount()
    
    -- Create an order
    local success, orderID = _G.GuildWorkOrders.CreateOrder("WTB", "[Iron Ore]", 20, "5g")
    
    -- Search orders
    local orders = _G.GuildWorkOrders.SearchOrders("Iron")
    
    -- Show/hide UI
    _G.GuildWorkOrders.ShowUI()
    _G.GuildWorkOrders.HideUI()
end
```
