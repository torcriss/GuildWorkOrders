- Always deploy (deploy.sh) locally changes so that I can test them once changes are completed.
- you are forgetting to always deploy.sh when there's a change
- make sure to always update the toc files and lua files for version change when releasing
- I also always just want the latest release available on github. We should just have 1 version available.
